            <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
            <p>JavaScript is another form of language that works with HTML and CSS to make more complex sites.</p>
            <p>Appart from simple shapes, letters, and images - It can add much more user interactivity to the page.</p>
            <p>Using JavaScript, you can add things like this button that tells the time!</p>
                <br>
            <button onclick="document.getElementById('TIMMEE').innerHTML=Date()">CLICK MEE!!</button>
            <p Id="TIMMEE">[Time will be here]</p>
                <br>
            <p>but why add JavaScript? How can this be helpful?</p>
            <p>as said previously, JS adds interactivity with the user to the page which can make tons of things like sign-in pages or even games.</p>
            <p>But it's also worth to mention another plus towards JavaScript.</p>

            <p>When coding, problems will more than likely occur; however, there's no telling where or what.</p>
            <p>With JS, it introduces console logs!</p>
            <p>by using console logs, it can report issues that appear in the code but will only give you the idea. </p>
            <p>To look at the console log, it varries but one way is with Ctrl + Shift + I and to click the "console" tab</p>
            <p>Since were talkin about it, why not take a look at it.</p>

            <h2>Stating the Variables</h2>
                <br>
                <hr>
                <br>
            <p>Variables can be thought of like x in math.</p>
            <p>In terms of the problem, x can mean one thing and one thing only.</p>
            <p>With JavaScript in mind, x holds information that applies to THAT page.
            <p>there many forms of x that can exist:</p>
            <ol style="text-align:center; list-style-position:inside;">
                <p><i>Null - "x" that has no value</i></p>
                <p><i>Undefined - "x" that HAS value but isn't assigned to anything.</i></p>
                <p><i>Boolean - makes "x" true or false (there or not) based on other values.</i></p>
                <p><i>String - a combination of values (numbers and words) so like "x" combined with "y".</i></p>
                <p><i>Number - AKA an integer and is basically just a number.</i></p>                
                <p><i>Bigint - A number that is too large for the computer to handle.</i></p>
                <p><i>Object - A more complex version of a string as they hold alot more than just variables</i></p>
                    </ol>
                    <hr>
                <p>Alright, so we have all these forms of variables, but how do we even use them properly?</p>
                    <br>
                <p>When you have the variables you want to add, you firsr need to DECLARE them.</p>
                <p>Tell the website that "x" exists in the document</p>
                <p>There are many different keywords that are used to declare a variable as there is keywords period:</p>
            <ol style="text-align:center; list-style-position:inside;">
                <p><i>Var - declares a variable that is able to be changed later on in code.</i></p>
                <p><i>Let - declares a block variable that will always stick with what was named first.</i></p>
                <p><i>Const - declares a block constant or cannot be changed period (will crash if done so).</i></p>
                        <br>
                    <p>as for the ones below, they are more like branches towards declaring as they also serve an ability towards doing so.</p>
                        <br>
                <p><i>If - marks a block of statements to activate when something happens.</i></p>
                <p><i>Switch - Marks a block of statements to activate in different cases.</i></p>                
                <p><i>For - marks a block of statements to activate in a loop.</i></p>
                <p><i>Function - declares a function.</i></p>
                <p><i>Return - exits a function.</i></p>
                <p><i>Try - implements error handling to a block of statements.</i></p>
                    </ol>
                    <hr>
                <p>For this example well write "Let x, y, z;"</p>
                <p>Now, you need to STATE to the document what "x" means.</p>
                <p>So lets write that "x = 3;", "y = 5;" and "z = x + y;"</p>
                <p>By using all this stated information, you can combo them in many ways you'd desire</p>
                    <br>
                <p>Take a look at the example below, hover over it to see how it looks compiled.</p>
                <img Id="EXAMPLE" src="JSmathEasyCode.png" alt="CODE EXAMPLE" width="516" height="182" onmouseover="src = 'JSmathEasyANSWER.png'" onmouseout="src = 'JSmathEasyCode.png'">
                        <!--onmouseout is when the mouse isn't on top of it ... From onmouseover to onmouseout is how to revert an image back and forth with mouse-->

                    <br>
                <p>As said in the Console Log, there's a section named "Script" within a document, lets talk about it.</p>
                <p>Seeing the example image above, the code of "document.getElementbyId()" is one of the more iconic and easier examples to use in JS</p>
                <p>But there's different ways of adding it depending on preference</p>
                <p>going back to CSS, we can agree that there are differnt forms of adding styles.</p>
                <p>JS is no different</p>
                <p>When adding code you can either add it directly to the HTML element, within the head so it stays general, or on a seperate file.</p>
                <p><b>These are Called .js files</b></p>
                <p>Just like CSS, they come with their pros and cons each</p>
                <ol style="text-align:center; list-style-position:inside;">
                    <p><em>External JS - with these, you can create tons of code that combinds with certain HTML elements and easily apply to all files.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Internal JS - Like External, you can make code within the "head" that can combind with HTML elements automatically.</em></p>
                    <p><em>Inline JS - This can work more precicely on certain elements you want to have using JS.</em></p>
